# javascript-quiz-game
A timed short quiz game about javascript concepts that stores high scores.

## Description

For interviews for programming jobs, there are often live coding questions that you'll need to be prepared for. This project is a quiz about simple JavaScript concepts to study up on, but it is also a means to apply and build on my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a functional quiz. THe quiz is 60 seconds long, and it will inform the user if the choice they selected was right or wrong, but will not tell them the correct answer. Every wrong answer will lose 10 seconds from the clock. The quiz is only 5 questions long.
